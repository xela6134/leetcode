# Leetcode Solutions

### Description
- Almost entirely done in C++
- Doing whatever questions I feel like from different sources
- (If you **REALLY** want to run this) you need to install CMake to run these solutions. Install `cmake` according to your current environment.

### Instructions
1. Run `cmake -B build` for initial setup. This will create a `build` directory.
2. Run `make` inside the `build` directory. 
3. Execute the programs made inside the `build` directory, using `./blah`
